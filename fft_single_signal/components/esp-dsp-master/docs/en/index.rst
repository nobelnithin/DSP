ESP-DSP Library
***************
The ESP-DSP it’s a C/C++ library that contains functions and classes for high performance calculations related applications. It includes implementations for different functionality, like:  matrix multiplication, FFTs, filters, vector math operations and support functions for DSP applications development. 

The library also includes examples of how to use the library.

The ESP-DSP it’s the official DSP library for the Espressif chips. It contains optimized versions for ESP32 and ESP32-S3 chips, and will contain optimized versions for the new chips.
